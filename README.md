# Student-Accommodation-Website in .NET

The website fulfils all the pre-defined criteria for the project. This criteria includes implementing an authorisation mechanism where landlords, students and admins have certain access control right in the system. All effort was put into fulfilling the marking criteria for the project which did not include some important security related implementations which would need to be addressed if this website were to be launched.
